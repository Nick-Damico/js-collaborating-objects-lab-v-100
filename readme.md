# JavaScript Collaborating Objects Lab

This is a JavaScript Version of the Flatiron ruby-collaborating-objects-lab-v-000.

## Objective

1. Gain a deeper understanding of object relations.
2. Build classes that interact with one another through associations and behavior.
3. Use ES6 JavaScript Class Syntax

## Instructions

This is a test-driven lab using Jest. Use the test file and test output to understand what is being asked of you as you follow the guidelines below.

In this lab, we'll be dealing with an `Artist` class, a `Song` class, and an `MP3Importer` class.

Because of the relationships between your classes, the `Artist` tests, i.e. the tests in `test/artist.test.js`, rely on some code in the `Song` class and vice versa. So, as you proceed through solving this lab, you will go back and forth between coding in `Artist` and `Song`.
